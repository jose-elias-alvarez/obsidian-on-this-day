# Obsidian On This Day

Show your daily notes from this day in a simple panel view. Inspired by [Day One](https://dayoneapp.com)'s On This Day feature.

## Usage

After installing, open the On This Day panel using the `Open On This Day panel` ribbon icon or the `On This Day: Open panel` command. (Once opened, you won't have to re-open it unless you close it.)

On open, the panel will show a list of daily notes from the current date (i.e. notes from the same date and month but different years) together with a preview. If you switch to a different daily note, the panel will update to show notes from that date.

## Configuration

The plugin depends on the [Daily notes core plugin](https://help.obsidian.md/Plugins/Daily+notes) and uses its Date format and New file location to determine where to find daily notes. Make sure those are set appropriately.

In addition, the plugin exposes the following option:

- Show image preview: by default, the plugin will include the first embedded image from each daily note in its preview. Turn this off if you don't want to see it.
